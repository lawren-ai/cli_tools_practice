# CLI Tools Practice

This project contains a collection of practice scripts and utilities for building and using Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools in Python. The goal is to strengthen understanding of CLI design, argument parsing, and scripting workflows.

## Features

* Practice scripts using `argparse`, `click`, and `typer`
* Examples of common CLI tool functionalities (e.g., file operations, data formatting, logging)
* Modular and beginner-friendly code structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli_tools_practice.git
cd cli_tools_practice
```

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

Install dependencies if needed:

```bash
